    "\n",
    "This analysis provides three recommendations to the Microsoft executive team:\n",
    "1. If profitability is the goal; a <b>'Family'</b> genre movie should be funded, produced, and released to maximize profits gained. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. If recognition is the goal; a <b>'War'</b> genre movie should be produced as this genre has garnered the highest average recognition and fame on average to date.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The target release date of the movie produced should be in the month of <b>'June'</b>. June has proven to show the highest number of viewership and ticket sales, and thus should maximize potential profitability and recognition."

    "- Distinguishing between domestic and international profitability. This recommendation could use existing data, but would provide more specific insights on profitability depending on the target audience desired.\n",
    "- Identifying the best genre of movie for both profitability and recognition. This recommendation would require deeper analysis with existing data, but provide a more gradient recommendation that is balances priorities.\n",
    "- Predicting what genres to avoid. This modeling would identify genres that have performed poorly which would shorten the list of viable options available."
